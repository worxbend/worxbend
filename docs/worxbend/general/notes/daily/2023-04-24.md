# Ansible
Ansible copy - https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/copy_module.html

```yaml
- name: Copy file with owner and permissions
  ansible.builtin.copy:
    src: /srv/myfiles/foo.conf
    dest: /etc/foo.conf
    owner: foo
    group: foo
    mode: '0644'
```

- `src` and `dest` support the substitution of environment variables (`src: $HOME/myfiles/foo.conf`).
- `owner` and `group` do not support substitution of environment variables: `$USER` or `GROUP`. The names should be defined explicitly.
