# WS2812 LEDs 

This module generally don’t produce excessive heat, but the heat can accumulate depending on usage conditions. Here are key factors to consider:

## 1. Power and Brightness Settings
High Brightness (Full White, RGB 255,255,255): Each LED can draw up to 60 mA, which may generate noticeable heat.
Lower Brightness or Single Colors: Reduces power consumption and heat output significantly.

## 2. Ventilation and Heat Dissipation
Enclosing LEDs in a 3D-printed PLA case with only 1 mm clearance could lead to heat buildup, especially in continuous operation or when multiple LEDs are on full brightness.

## 3. PLA and Heat Tolerance
PLA starts softening around 60–65°C and deforms at higher temperatures. Even though WS2812 LEDs are unlikely to reach this temperature under typical conditions, continuous operation at high brightness could bring the temperature uncomfortably close, risking deformation or weakening of the PLA cover.

Suggestions

 - Brightness Control: Implement dynamic brightness control to limit heat.
 - Ventilation: Add small ventilation holes if possible to allow heat to dissipate.
 - Thermal Testing: Run a test at full brightness for a few hours and monitor the internal temperature. A basic thermal sensor or an IR thermometer would help check if heat reaches critical levels.
