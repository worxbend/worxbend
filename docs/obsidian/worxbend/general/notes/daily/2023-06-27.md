### Paths Changes Filter

To trigger a *GitHub Actions* job only if a selected file or directory is changed, you can use the [`paths-filter`](https://github.com/dorny/paths-filter) in your workflow. The [`paths-filter`](https://github.com/dorny/paths-filter) allows you to specify the files or directories that should trigger the job. Here's how you can use it:
```yml
- uses: dorny/paths-filter@v2
  id: changes
  with:
    filters: |
      src:
        - 'src/**'
  # run only if some file in 'src' folder was changed
- if: steps.changes.outputs.src == 'true'
  run: ...
```

- Paths expressions are evaluated using [picomatch](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch) library. Documentation for path expression format can be found on the project GitHub page.
- Picomatch [dot](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#options) option is set to true. Globbing will also match paths where file or folder name starts with a dot.
- It's recommended to quote your path expressions with `'` or `"`. Otherwise, you will get an error if it starts with `*`.

### Dockerfile: how to change PATH variable

DO THIS:
```Dockerfile
ENV PATH="$PATH:/etc/profile"
```

DO NOT DO THIS:
```Dockerfile
RUN export PATH="$PATH:/etc/profile"
```

The changes applied in single `RUN` instruction will not be available subsequent `RUN` instructions. It means that global `PATH` variable will not be changed.
```Dockerfile
RUN export PATH="$PATH:/etc/profile"; echo $PATH
```
If you specify multiple action within single run instruction, then it can be a valid approach.
