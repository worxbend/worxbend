## TODO: implement coockiecutter project templating instead of g8 project-templating
##  The main benefit is the generation time (avoidance of sbt sources compilation)
##  The cookiecutter provides possibility to define custom python script with pre/post hooks
##  in order to add additional step around project generation.
##  It also provides mechanism to generate specific files within existing project
